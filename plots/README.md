# Plots Directory

This directory contains PDF files for the Buypolar Capital research plots gallery.

## File Naming Convention

All PDF files should use lowercase with underscores:
- ✅ `schibsted_vs_aapl_price_data.pdf`
- ❌ `IPO_Analysis_UBER.pdf`

## Important Notes

1. **Case Sensitivity**: GitHub Pages is case-sensitive, so all filenames must match exactly between the repository and website links.

2. **File Tracking**: These PDF files are tracked by Git and should be committed to the repository.

3. **Access**: PDFs are served via GitHub raw URLs for better compatibility.

## Current Files

The plots are automatically loaded from `plots_data.json` in the root directory.

## Troubleshooting

If PDFs are not loading:
1. Check that the file exists in this directory
2. Verify filename casing matches exactly
3. Ensure the file is committed to the repository
4. Wait 1-5 minutes after pushing for GitHub Pages to update
