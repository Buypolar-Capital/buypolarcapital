# Quant Project Ideas

A collection of super technical and practical quant projects to level up my skills in R, Python, and quantitative finance. Focus areas: trading strategies, mathematical modeling, machine learning, and infrastructure.

## Core Projects

- [ ] **High-Frequency Trading Simulator with Latency Modeling**  
  - *What*: Build an HFT sim with order book dynamics, latency, and slippage using tick data (Binance API, Nasdaq).  
  - *Tech*: Python (`pandas`, `numba`, `asyncio`), R (`ggplot2` for viz).  
  - *Flex*: Simulate latency arbitrage with a Poisson process for order arrivals.  
  - *Why*: HFT is bleeding-edge—shows I can handle tick data like a pro.

- [ ] **Monte Carlo Option Pricing with Exotic Payoffs**  
  - *What*: Price exotic options (Asian, barrier, lookback) with Heston or Merton jump-diffusion.  
  - *Tech*: Python (`numpy`, `scipy`, `multiprocessing`), R (`sde`, `plotly`).  
  - *Flex*: Add variance reduction (antithetic/control variates), benchmark vs. Black-Scholes.  
  - *Why*: Exotic options + SDEs = quant cred.

- [ ] **Portfolio Optimization with Regime-Switching Models**  
  - *What*: Optimize portfolios adapting to market regimes (bull/bear) via Hidden Markov Models.  
  - *Tech*: Python (`hmmlearn`, `cvxpy`), R (`depmixS4`, `PortfolioAnalytics`).  
  - *Flex*: Include transaction costs/leverage, backtest on S&P 500 data (`yfinance`).  
  - *Why*: Regime-switching beats static models—shows macro chops.

- [ ] **Crypto Market Microstructure Analysis**  
  - *What*: Simulate a crypto LOB (BTC/USD), add a market-making bot with dynamic spreads.  
  - *Tech*: Python (`websocket`, `matplotlib`), R (`Hawkes`, `highcharter`).  
  - *Flex*: Quantify spoofing/wash trading via fake orders and slippage.  
  - *Why*: Crypto + microstructure = cutting-edge vibes.

- [ ] **Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Hedging**  
  - *What*: Train an RL agent (DQN/PPO) to hedge options in a stochastic volatility market.  
  - *Tech*: Python (`gym`, `tensorflow`/`pytorch`, `pandas`), R (`ReinforcementLearning`).  
  - *Flex*: Add transaction costs, compare to delta-hedging.  
  - *Why*: RL in finance is hot—blends AI and quant rigor.

- [ ] **Copula-Based Risk Simulation for Multi-Asset Portfolios**  
  - *What*: Simulate tail risk for stocks/bonds/crypto with copulas for non-linear dependencies.  
  - *Tech*: Python (`copulae`, `statsmodels`, `numpy`), R (`copula`, `vinecopula`).  
  - *Flex*: Stress-test (e.g., 2008 crash), compute ES vs. VaR.  
  - *Why*: Copulas are a risk management flex—super technical.

## Core Trading Strategies

- [ ] **Relative Value Arbitrage**  
  - Pair trade mispricings in correlated assets (e.g., Schibsted A/B shares).  

- [ ] **Index Effect Trading**  
  - Model stocks entering/leaving indexes (e.g., OSEBX) for rebalancing effects.  

- [ ] **IPO Momentum & Mean Reversion**  
  - Analyze post-IPO price behavior (short-term momentum, long-term reversion).  

- [ ] **Futures Basis Trading**  
  - Exploit futures vs. spot mispricing for arbitrage.  

- [ ] **Fixed-Income Yield Curve Trades**  
  - Build butterfly spreads or steepener/flattener trades on yield curves.

## Statistical & ML-Based Strategies

- [ ] **Machine Learning for Mean Reversion**  
  - Use SVM/Random Forest to detect overbought/oversold conditions.  

- [ ] **Bayesian Portfolio Optimization**  
  - Implement Black-Litterman for portfolio construction.  

- [ ] **Options Volatility Arbitrage**  
  - Trade implied vs. historical vol with stat arb models.  

- [ ] **Sentiment-Based Trading**  
  - Scrape news (Bloomberg, E24) for sentiment-driven signals.  

- [ ] **Intraday Liquidity Provision**  
  - Develop VWAP/TWAP strategies for high-volume trading.

## Stochastic & Mathematical Finance

- [ ] **Stochastic Control for Optimal Execution**  
  - Solve Almgren-Chriss to minimize execution costs.  

- [ ] **Path-Dependent Derivatives Pricing**  
  - Monte Carlo for exotic options (Asian, Barrier, Lookback).  

- [ ] **Heston Model Calibration**  
  - Calibrate Heston to real options data.  

- [ ] **Optimal Market Making via RL**  
  - Q-learning for dynamic bid-ask spreads.  

- [ ] **Regime-Switching Models for Macro Trading**  
  - HMM for economic regime shifts.

## Super Technical Quant Projects

- [ ] **Intraday Statistical Arbitrage**  
  - Z-score mean reversion on correlated assets (ETFs, A/B shares).  

- [ ] **Regime-Switching Volatility Models**  
  - HMM/GARCH-switching for calm vs. crisis markets.  

- [ ] **Cross-Asset Relative Value Trades**  
  - Exploit futures/ETF/spot mismatches (e.g., oil ETFs vs. Brent).  

- [ ] **Macro Factor Nowcasting**  
  - Use real-time data (freight rates, Google Trends) for macro shifts.  

- [ ] **Options Skew Trading**  
  - Trade skew patterns (SPX puts/calls) with neutral hedging.

## Tips to Level Up

- **Data Sources**: Quandl, Yahoo Finance, Kaggle, Binance/Kraken APIs.  
- **Polish**: Clean READMEs with LaTeX math for models.  
- **Scale**: Start small (one asset), then go big (multi-asset, real-time).
